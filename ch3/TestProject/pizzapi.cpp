// Test Project - Pizza PI
//
// Joeâ€™s Pizza Palace needs a program to calculate the number of pizzas to
// prepare for a party. The program should ask the user for the number of
// people who will be at the party and for the diameter of the pizzas to be
// ordered. It should then calculate and display the number
// of pizzas to purchase. 
//
// To do this calculation, make the following assumptions:
//
// - Each person attending the party is expected to eat 4 slices of pizza
// - A slice of pizza should have an area of 14.125 square inches.
//
// The output should be displayed using fixed point notation, rounding to one
// decimal place of precision. Your program should use C++ named constants for
// the math constant PI and for the area of a slice of pizza.
//
// Your screenshot must show the following test case:
//     A party of 35 people with 16 inch pizzas
//
