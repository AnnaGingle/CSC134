This repo stores all the source code for my various assignments and experiments involving my Introduction to C++ class. For licensing reasons, I'm not including the problems themselves nor the Lab Manuals which I am following to produce my lab writeups and code. 

I understand that this repo has little to no context and is therefore useless to most people looking at it. This repo is effectively just serving as a spot to host my homework and teaching me how to use git. 

I have each of the relevant materials separated by chapter in folders, and a miscellaneous folder called experiments which is mostly composed of snippets and short, useless things, again, without context.
