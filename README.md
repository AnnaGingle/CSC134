======

This repo stores all the source code for my various assignments and experiments involving my Introduction to C++ class. For licensing reasons, I'm not including the problems themselves nor the Lab Manuals which I am following to produce my lab writeups and code. 

I understand that this repo has little to no context and is therefore useless to most people looking at it. This repo is effectively just serving as a spot to host my homework and teaching me how to use git. 


## Organization 
Homework is organized into folders by chapter, ex. [ch1](https://github.com/wbv/CSC134/tree/master/ch1), [ch2](https://github.com/wbv/CSC134/tree/master/ch2).
[experiments](https://github.com/wbv/CSC134/tree/master/experiments) is a folder of miscellaneous programs that may or may not contain any actual functionality.
