// Option 1: Write a program that performs a survey tally on beverages. The
// program should prompt for the next person until a sentinel value of â€“1 is
// entered to terminate the program. Each person participating in the survey
// should choose their favorite beverage from the following list:
//  
//     1. Coffee    2. Tea    3. Coke    4. Orange Juice
